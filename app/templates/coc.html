        <div class="highlight">
            <p>The Python Togo community is committed to providing a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive
                environment for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
                body size, race, religion, or technical experience.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
        <p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge
            to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
            body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and
            expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
            race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p>

        <h2>Our Standards</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
            <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>

            <li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
            <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>

                permission</li>
            <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Responsibilities of Moderators</h2>
        <p>Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They
            will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem
            inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>This Code of Conduct applies within all Python Togo community spaces, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Collaborative projects and code repositories</li>
            <li>Workshops and training sessions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Enforcement</h2>
        <p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community
            leaders responsible for enforcement. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and
            fairly.</p>

        <p>All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
        </p>

        <h2>Enforcement Guidelines</h2>
        <p>Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any
